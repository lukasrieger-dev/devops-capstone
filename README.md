# devops-capstone
Udacity AWS Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program's capstone project.

In this project I applied the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

Working in AWS
Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
Building pipelines
Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
Building Kubernetes clusters
Building Docker containers in pipelines
As a capstone project, the directions are rather more open-ended than they were in the previous projects in the program. You will also be able to make some of your own choices in this capstone, for the type of deployment you implement, which services you will use, and the nature of the application you develop.

I developed a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with either blue/green deployment or rolling deployment. I also developed Continuous Integration steps, including typographical checking (aka “linting”).

After completing my Continuous Integration I set up Continuous Deployment, which includes:

Pushing the built Docker container(s) to the Docker repository and
Deploying these Docker container(s) to a small Kubernetes cluster. For the Kubernetes cluster I used AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.
